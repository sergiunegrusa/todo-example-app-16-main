# TodoExampleApp

This project was generated using [Nx](https://nx.dev).

## Assignment description

The current repository contains a single application `todo-app`. This app is a basic todo app where a user can add new todos, toggle todos and filter the view to show all/completed/remaining todos.

At the moment the application is missing a delete-todo functionality. Implement the delete-todo functionality by adding a delete button for each todo.
- Your implementation should utilize `ngrx` to match the redux pattern used in the rest of the app (actions + effects + reducers). The `ngrx` library is already included and used in the app.
- Your code should lint without any errors
- You're welcome to add unit tests and integration tests for the code you write
- It is not required to style the application, but if you decide you can leverage the `angular/material` library already included in the `package.json`

You will not have write-access to the repository. Please keep the code locally or push it to your own GitHub account.

Once you're done with your implementation, please reach out to us and set up a time to review the work together.

**_Note: this repository has been generated with Nx. No knowledge of Nx is required for the implementation. Please read below for the prerequisites and the different commands you can use to serve, lint and test your work! Good luck :)_**
